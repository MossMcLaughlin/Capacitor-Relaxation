	<p>  Modeling electric potential can be done anaylytically by soving<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace's_equation"> Laplace's equation.</a> This requires boundry conditions and can prove very difficult. A useful method for finding electric potential is by matching the potential at all points to the average of the potentials around it. Here is a model placing two opposite charged counducting plates in a grounded box. </p>
